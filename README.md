# ETL

IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System) data is being for this project.
https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data

Weâ€™ve isolated three CSV files from IPEDS to extrract, transform and load.

Cleaned up some messy data, joined the tables we created, loaded into a postgres relational database.

The ETL process and go-forward loaded production database may be useful for future projects.
