# ETL

We have decided to use IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System) as the source of our data for this project.

Weâ€™ve isolated three CSV files from IPEDS to extrract, transform and load.

We will be cleaning up some messy data, joining the tables we create, load into  a postgres relational database.  The ETL process and go-forward loaded production database may be useful for future projects.
